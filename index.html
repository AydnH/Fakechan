	<h2>Favourite thing from the WCI arc?

I really liked the character interaction between the Big Mom pirates and the civilians. They might not be perfect but they still acted like an actual kingdom should and probably gave more of a shit about their subjects than most nobility in the series.

It was also a nice contrast to the Doflamingo family when they pretty much just used Dressrosa as a means to an end for their SMILE production</h2>

It's crazy. Do they really have nothing better to do? They also never have any real criticism.</p>

buy or build a house somewhere near a city, ideally where I can connect to a fiber line. 

build a garage and get a couple shitboxes/classics to restore. Don't need anything fancy, or super/hyper cars.</p>
